# Investment Strategy & Analysis: 11042 N Saint Vrain Dr, Lyons, CO

**Document Version: 1.0**
**Date: October 3, 2025**

This document outlines the investment thesis, market analysis, operating model, financial projections, and risk assessment for the acquisition and operation of the property at 11042 N Saint Vrain Dr, Lyons, CO.

## 1. Executive Summary

### Opportunity
The core opportunity is to acquire a secluded, 5,512 sq ft creek-side residence on 12.82 acres. The strategy is to operate it, under Boulder County’s owner-occupied Short-Term Rental (STR) rules, as a dual-purpose asset: a licensed **Healing Center** for Ceremonia's core business and an **overnight STR hub** serving the high-demand Lyons / Estes Park / Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) corridor.

* **Asking Price:** $1,399,000 (as of Sept 9, 2025)

### The Ceremonia Advantage
Ceremonia is a leading brand in the U.S. natural-medicine healing space, providing a significant competitive advantage through brand recognition and a captive demand funnel.

* **Company-Reported Metrics (Sept 2025):**
    * **50+** retreats conducted.
    * **330+** alumni network, with **120+** located in Colorado.
* **Strategic Fit:** This model extends the Ceremonia Spaces brand as an infrastructure provider under Colorado's Natural Medicine Health Act (NMHA), which was implemented in 2025.

### Why Now?
The RMNP/Estes/Lyons corridor is a top-tier mountain-gateway demand engine for lodging. National Park Service (NPS) visitation remains exceptionally high.

* **RMNP Visitation (2024):** ~4.15 million visits.
* **U.S. Park System (2024):** Set a record with 331.9 million visits, indicating sustained, high demand for gateway lodging.

> **Thesis:** By combining Ceremonia's captive B2B demand with the strong seasonal tourism market, this property can generate premium nightly revenue while adhering to local regulations, offering a unique and profitable investment.

---

## 3. Regulatory Framework & Compliance

### Unincorporated Boulder County STR Rules
* **License Requirement:** An owner-occupied STR license is required. The property must be the owner's primary residence.
* **Zoning Allowance:** STRs are permitted in all zone districts, including this property's "O" (Open) designation.
* **Occupancy Limit:** Occupancy is capped at **8 persons** or the capacity of the On-site Wastewater Treatment System (OWTS), whichever is more restrictive.

### NMHA Context
* The business operates under the framework of Colorado’s **Natural Medicine Health Act (NMHA)**, positioning Ceremonia Spaces as an infrastructure provider for state-licensed facilitators operating within a licensed healing center. All activities are subject to oversight by the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA).

### Compliance Plan
1.  **Residency:** Operate Saint Vrain as the owner’s primary residence to meet the key license requirement.
2.  **Licensing:** Obtain the Boulder County owner-occupied STR license.
3.  **Operations:** Ensure all healing sessions and overnight stays are structured to align with the county's headcount, parking, and septic capacity limits.

## 4. Market Analysis & Demand Drivers

### Gateway Demand
The property is perfectly situated between Lyons and Estes Park, the primary gateway to **Rocky Mountain National Park**. RMNP is consistently among the top-visited U.S. national parks, driving year-round demand for high-quality lodging.

### Local STR Performance Indicators
Public dashboard data indicates a strong existing STR market that this premium property can outperform.

| Location | Avg. Occupancy | Avg. Daily Rate (ADR) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lyons** | ~51–63% | $260–$286 | Baseline for the local area. |
| **Estes Park**| ~56–63% | $359–$413 | Gateway market, higher rates. |

> **Market Takeaway:** The property's luxury status, acreage, and riverfront setting allow it to command premium pricing above the market median. The Ceremonia demand funnel provides a source of non-commodity, high-value bookings (retreats, trainings) to complement seasonal tourism and smooth revenue during shoulder seasons.

## 5. Operating Model

### Rooms & Spaces
* **4 Therapy/Healing Rooms:** Available for individual nightly rental at **$900/night**.
* **2 Ceremony Rooms (Full Buyout):** The entire property can be booked for retreats or practicums at **$3,000/night**, which includes use of the 4 therapy rooms.

### Illustrative Monthly Pacing
The model projects a mix of full buyouts and individual room rentals, with scenarios built to be conservative relative to a pure commercial model due to owner-occupancy rules. A "month" is defined as 30 nights.

| Scenario | Buyout Nights | Therapy Room Occupancy (on non-buyout nights) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | 4 nights/mo | 35% |
| **Base** | 6 nights/mo | 50% |
| **High** | 8 nights/mo | 65% |

## 6. Financial Projections: Revenue Scenarios

Based on the operating model, the following revenue projections are illustrative.

| Scenario | Buyout Nights | Therapy Occ. (on non-buyout nights) | Therapy Revenue / mo | Buyout Revenue / mo | **Total Revenue / mo** | **Total Revenue / yr** |
| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | 4 | 35% | $32,760 | $12,000 | **$44,760** | **$537,120** |
| **Base** | 6 | 50% | $43,200 | $18,000 | **$61,200** | **$734,400** |
| **High** | 8 | 65% | $51,480 | $24,000 | **$75,480** | **$905,760** |

## 7. Financial Projections: OpCo Operating Economics

This illustrates the profitability of the Operating Company (OpCo) before paying its master lease rent to the property-holding entity (LandCo).

**Assumptions (Base Case):**
* **Variable Costs:** ~13% (cleaning, laundry, supplies, platform fees).
* **Fixed OpEx:** ~$3,500/mo (utilities, internet, insurance, marketing).
* **Management Overhead:** 8% of gross revenue.

| Metric | Low Case | Base Case | High Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gross Revenue / mo** | $44,760 | $61,200 | $75,480 |
| Variable Costs (~13%) | ($6,005) | ($8,136) | ($9,950) |
| Management (8%) | ($3,581) | ($4,896) | ($6,038) |
| Fixed OpEx | ($3,500) | ($3,500) | ($3,500) |
| **EBITDA (before rent)** | **$31,674** | **$44,668** | **$55,991** |

> **Coverage Insight:** In the Base Case, the OpCo generates enough cash flow to comfortably service a **$12,500–$14,000 NNN master lease** to the LandCo with a significant cushion.

## 8. Financing & Returns Analysis (LandCo)

This section models the returns for the property-holding entity (LandCo).

### Financing Assumptions
* **Mortgage Rate:** **6.95%** (30-yr fixed), based on market data from Freddie Mac and Mortgage News Daily for investment properties in Sept 2025.
* **Down Payment:** **25%** (conservative underwriting).
* **Closing Costs:** **3%** of purchase price.

### Debt & Equity Sizing (Illustrative)
* **Purchase Price:** $1,399,000
* **Down Payment (25%):** $349,750
* **Loan Amount (75%):** $1,049,250
* **Monthly P&I:** **$6,945** (at 6.95% on a 30-yr amortization)
* **Total Cash Invested:** $349,750 (down) + $41,970 (closing) = **$391,720**

### LandCo Returns (Varying NNN Master Lease Rents)
This table shows the LandCo's returns based on the NNN rent paid by the OpCo. NOI is assumed to equal NNN rent.

| NNN Rent / mo | DSCR (Debt Service Coverage) | Annual Cash Flow | Cash-on-Cash Return |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $11,000 | **1.58x** | $48,654 | **12.4%** |
| $12,500 | **1.80x** | $66,654 | **17.0%** |
| $14,000 | **2.02x** | $84,654 | **21.6%** |

*Note: Year 1 principal paydown is ≈$10,800, which adds to the total return.*

## 9. Key Risks & Mitigations

* **Risk: Regulatory & License Fit**
    * The owner-occupied requirement and 8-person cap are strict constraints.
    * **Mitigation:** Design all retreat formats, staffing plans, and booking rules to remain under county caps. Prioritize smaller cohorts and individual weekday therapy rentals.

* **Risk: Flood & Wildfire Exposure**
    * The riverfront location and foothills setting present natural hazards.
    * **Mitigation:** Commission thorough flood, fire, and geotechnical diligence pre-closing. Price appropriate insurance coverage. Implement defensible-space landscaping and property hardening.

* **Risk: Seasonality**
    * Winter and shoulder seasons may soften demand from traditional tourists.
    * **Mitigation:** Leverage the Ceremonia B2B funnel for retreats, training practicums, and facilitator intensives that are calendar-driven, not tourist-driven, creating a stable baseload of demand.

* **Risk: Execution Complexity**
    * The hybrid model (residential + STR + healing center) requires stringent operational procedures.
    * **Mitigation:** Adapt the proven Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) from the Golden commercial playbook. Implement clear house rules, guest screening, and license-compliant maximums for parking and occupancy.

* **Risk (Positive): Exit Liquidity**
    * Unlike a niche commercial asset, this is a highly desirable residential property.
    * **Mitigation:** If the business model needs to pivot, the asset has strong resale viability to a traditional owner-user, providing a de-risked exit strategy.
