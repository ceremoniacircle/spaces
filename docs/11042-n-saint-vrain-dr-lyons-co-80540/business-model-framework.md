## 1. Market Analysis & Industry Trends

### 1.1 The Infrastructure Crisis

The regulated psychedelic services market faces a systemic shortage of compliant practice space. Data from Oregon's mature market provides clear evidence:

- **Facilitator-to-Center Ratio:** 13.8-to-1 (facilitators significantly outnumber available rooms/centers)
- **Market Structure:** Mix of micro-centers (1 room) and larger healing centers (3+ rooms)
- **Colorado Projection:** Even more pronounced shortage expected due to higher tourism demand and population density

### 1.2 Oregon Market Baseline (Q1 2025)

Oregon serves as the most mature regulated market for natural medicine services:

- **Quarterly Client Volume:** 1,509 clients
- **Annualized Sessions:** ~6,036 sessions/year
- **Average Revenue per Session:** $500

### 1.3 Colorado Market Size Projections

Colorado's market is projected to exceed Oregon's due to favorable demographic and tourism factors:

**Adjustment Multipliers:**
- **Tourism Multiplier:** 1.48x (Colorado attracts significantly more tourism)
- **Population Multiplier:** 1.43x (larger population base)

**Market Mix:**
- **Tourism-Driven Demand:** 80% of projected market
- **Domestic/Local Demand:** 20% of projected market

**Projected Annual Market Size:** ~8,885 sessions/year (Colorado baseline)

### 1.4 Competitive Landscape Benchmarks

Based on current approved and pending licenses in Colorado:

- **Micro-Centers (1 room):** Dominant market structure for independent facilitators
- **Healing Centers (3+ rooms):** Fewer in number but capture larger market share per facility
- **Total Licensed Room Capacity:** Estimated 69 rooms across all competitors (as of analysis date)

**Typical Market Share Calculation:**
- A 14-room facility represents approximately 20.29% of total market capacity (14/69 rooms)
- Larger facilities benefit from economies of scale and brand consolidation

## 3. Revenue Models & Pricing Strategy

Three complementary revenue models support financial projections:

### 3.1 Revenue Model 1: Top-Down Market Share

**Methodology:** Projects revenue based on capturing a proportional share of the total Colorado market.

**Core Assumptions:**
- **Baseline:** Oregon's 6,036 annual sessions
- **Colorado Market Size:** 8,885 sessions/year (after applying tourism and population multipliers)
- **Market Share:** Proportional to room count (e.g., 14 rooms / 69 total rooms = 20.29%)
- **Revenue per Session:** $500

**Example Calculation:**
- Total Market: 8,885 sessions/year
- Facility Share (20.29%): ~1,803 sessions/year
- Annual Revenue: ~$901,500

### 3.2 Revenue Model 2: Bottom-Up Utilization

**Methodology:** Projects revenue based on room utilization rates across phased rollout.

**Core Assumptions:**
- **Standard Room Price:** $497/day (all rooms)
- **Phased Rollout:**
  - Phase 1: 5 rooms
  - Phase 2: 10 rooms
  - Phase 3: 14 rooms (full build-out)
- **Days per Phase:** ~121.67 days (4 months)

**Utilization Scenarios:**
- **Low Utilization:** 25%
- **Base Utilization:** 50%
- **High Utilization:** 75%

**Example Calculation (Base Case, 50% Utilization):**
- Phase 1: 5 rooms × $497 × 121.67 days × 50% = ~$151,142
- Phase 2: 10 rooms × $497 × 121.67 days × 50% = ~$302,285
- Phase 3: 14 rooms × $497 × 121.67 days × 50% = ~$423,199
- **Total Annual Revenue:** ~$876,626

### 3.3 Revenue Model 3: Facilitator Onboarding

**Methodology:** Projects revenue based on steady onboarding of new facilitators into the network.

**Core Assumptions:**
- **Standard Room Price:** $497/day
- **Guaranteed Revenue Base:** ~$18,794/month (anchor tenants, long-term agreements)
- **Growth Driver:** New facilitators onboarded per month
- **Activity per Facilitator:** 2 room-days/month average
- **Seasonality:** 65% revenue slump in Nov/Dec (holiday slowdown)

**Onboarding Scenarios:**
- **Low Growth:** +4 facilitators/month
- **Base Growth:** +8 facilitators/month
- **High Growth:** +16 facilitators/month

**Example Calculation (Base Case, Month 12):**
- Cumulative Facilitators: 96 (8/month × 12 months)
- Variable Revenue: 96 × 2 room-days × $497 = $95,424/month
- Guaranteed Revenue: $18,794/month
- **Total Monthly Revenue (Month 12):** ~$114,218

### 3.4 Pricing Strategy

**Room Types & Pricing:**
- **Standard Therapy/Healing Rooms:** $497–$500/day (individual facilitator rental)
- **Premium Therapy Rooms (STR model):** $900/night (overnight stays in residential settings)
- **Full Facility Buyout:** $3,000/night (exclusive use for retreats, includes all therapy rooms)

**Pricing Philosophy:**
- Premium positioning above commodity STR rates
- Reflects compliance, turnkey operations, and brand value
- Tiered pricing for different use cases (daily practice vs. overnight retreat)

---

## 4. Regulatory & Compliance Framework

### 4.1 Colorado Natural Medicine Health Act (NMHA)

**Overview:**
- Implemented in 2025, Colorado's NMHA regulates psilocybin-assisted therapy services
- Positions Ceremonia Spaces as infrastructure provider for state-licensed facilitators
- All activities subject to oversight by the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA)

**Key Requirements:**
- Healing centers must obtain state licensing (~$6,000 cost per facility)
- Licensed facilitators must practice within licensed healing centers or approved settings
- Strict compliance and reporting requirements

### 4.2 STR Licensing (Applicable to Residential Properties)

**Owner-Occupied Requirements (Unincorporated Boulder County example):**
- STR license requires property to be owner's primary residence
- Zoning allowance varies by jurisdiction (check local zoning for each property)
- Occupancy caps (e.g., 8 persons or On-site Wastewater Treatment System capacity, whichever is more restrictive)

**Compliance Strategy:**
- Operate property as owner's primary residence to meet license requirements
- Structure all healing sessions and overnight stays to align with headcount, parking, and septic capacity limits
- Obtain appropriate local STR licenses before commencing operations

### 4.3 IRS §280E Considerations

**Background:**
- IRS §280E disallows business expense deductions for entities trafficking in controlled substances (Schedule I or II drugs)
- Psilocybin remains federally controlled, creating tax exposure for "plant-touching" activities

**Ceremonia's Structural Mitigation:**
- **Ceremonia Spaces, Inc. (OpCo):** Non-plant-touching entity providing real estate/infrastructure services
  - Revenue from room rentals, facility fees, ancillary services
  - Fully deductible operating expenses
- **Ceremonia Healing Center, Inc.:** Separate C-Corp holding the healing center license
  - Isolates all plant-touching activities
  - Absorbs all §280E tax exposure in a contained entity

### 6.2 Operating Margin Expectations

**OpCo Operating Economics (Base Case):**

| Metric                        | Percentage/Amount |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Variable Costs**            | ~13% of revenue   |
| **Management Overhead**       | 8% of revenue     |
| **Fixed OpEx**                | ~$3,500/month     |

---

## 9. Risk Factors & General Mitigations

### 9.1 Regulatory Risk

**Risk:** Evolving state and local regulations for natural medicine services and STR operations.

**Mitigations:**
- Design all operations to remain compliant with strictest known regulations
- Maintain active engagement with regulatory bodies (DORA, local planning departments)
- Structure entity framework to isolate regulatory risk (separate healing center license entity)

### 9.2 Market Adoption Risk

**Risk:** Slower-than-projected adoption of psilocybin-assisted services by the general public.

**Mitigations:**
- Diversified revenue models (market share, utilization, facilitator onboarding)
- Conservative projections based on Oregon's mature market data
- Captive B2B demand from facilitator training program (less dependent on general consumer adoption)

### 9.3 Execution Risk

**Risk:** Operational complexity of managing a hybrid healing center / hospitality business.

**Mitigations:**
- Proven SOPs from Ceremonia Journeys' 50+ retreats
- Phased rollout approach (test and validate operations before scaling)
- Experienced founder with hospitality/STR operational track record (scaled 24-home Las Vegas portfolio)

### 9.4 Financial / Leverage Risk

**Risk:** Debt service obligations during revenue ramp-up or market downturns.

**Mitigations:**
- Conservative underwriting (target DSCR >1.5x)
- Anchor tenant revenue provides baseline cash flow from Day 1
- Multiple revenue model scenarios (low, base, high) to stress-test projections
- OpCo/LandCo structure insulates real estate investors from operational volatility
