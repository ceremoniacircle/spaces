## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Property Intelligence Gathering

**Data Sources & Methods (October 2025 Standards):**
- **Primary Data:** Zillow, Redfin, CoStar, LoopNet scraping via Firecrawl API

- **AI-Powered Tools:** Daloopa, Leverton, Hyro for document extraction and underwriting automation
- **Public Records:** Title search, zoning verification, environmental databases
- **Visual Documentation:** High-resolution property images, drone footage analysis (if available)

**Core Data Points to Extract:**
```json
{
  "property": {
    "address": "Full address with coordinates",
    "pricing": {"list_price": 0, "price_per_sqft": 0, "zestimate": 0, "recent_sales": []},
    "physical": {"type": "", "sqft": 0, "lot_size": "", "year_built": 0, "condition": ""},
    "financial": {"taxes": 0, "insurance_est": 0, "hoa": 0, "utilities_est": 0},
    "zoning": {"current": "", "allowed_uses": [], "restrictions": []},
    "images": []
  },
  "market": {
    "submarket": "",
    "comparable_sales": [],
    "rental_comps": [],
    "absorption_rates": {},
    "supply_pipeline": {}
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Valuation & Financial Modeling

**Tri-Method Valuation Framework:**

1. **Income Approach (Primary for Investment Properties)**
   - Project stabilized NOI with 3-5 year ramp-up curve
   - Apply market cap rate (verify via October 2025 CBRE/JLL reports)
   - Conduct DCF analysis with terminal value calculation
   - Model multiple revenue scenarios: base case, upside case, stress case
   - **October 2025 Benchmark:** Multifamily cap rates 4.5-6.5%, Office 6.5-9.5%, Industrial 5.0-7.0%, Retail 6.0-8.5%

2. **Sales Comparison Approach**
   - Identify 5-10 comparable sales within 12 months and 5-mile radius
   - Adjust for size, condition, location, and market timing
   - Calculate adjusted price per sqft and confidence intervals
   - Cross-reference with Zillow Zestimate and automated valuation models (AVMs)

3. **Cost Approach (Validation Check)**
   - Estimate land value via comparable land sales
   - Calculate replacement cost new using Marshall & Swift or CoreLogic data
   - Apply age-life depreciation and functional obsolescence adjustments
   - Add land + depreciated improvements for maximum justifiable price

**Capital Stack Design (Optimize for Risk/Return and Tax Efficiency):**

```
SAMPLE CAPITAL STACK ($5M Total Capitalization):

Senior Debt (65% LTV): $3,250,000
├── Lender: Regional bank or CMBS
├── Interest Rate: 7.5% (SOFR + 275bps)
├── Amortization: 30 years
├── Term: 7 years (balloon)
├── DSCR Required: 1.50x
└── Recourse: Non-recourse with standard carveouts

Mezzanine Debt (10% of cap stack): $500,000
├── Lender: Private debt fund or HNWI
├── Interest Rate: 12% current pay (can structure as PIK)
├── Term: 5 years (must be subordinate to senior)
├── Equity Kicker: 10-15% of profits after preferred return
└── Intercreditor Agreement: Required with senior lender

Preferred Equity (15% of cap stack): $750,000
├── Investors: Family offices, HNWIs
├── Preferred Return: 10% annualized, compounding
├── Profit Participation: 20% of profits after pref return satisfied
